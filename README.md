# bwldata

The ultimate goal of this repository is to create an R package for teaching and research that allows users to import pre-formatted data from the Bundeswahlleiterin (German Federal Election Commissioner) directly into R. For now, it is mostly a way for me to keep track of the data transformations I have done to prepare my seminars.

- The data is available here: [`data/bwl.rds`](data/bwl.rds)
- The data transformation is done here: [`data-raw/bwl.R`](data-raw/bwl.R)
